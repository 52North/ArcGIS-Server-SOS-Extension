ArcGIS-Server-SOS-Extension
===========================

The Sensor Observation Service (SOS) extension for ArcGIS Server is implemented as a so-called Server Object Extension (SOE). It allows querying of observations, metadata about procedures (= sensors), as well as descriptions of features (of interest) observed by the sensors. The interface is compliant with the SOS 2.0 standard from OGC.
